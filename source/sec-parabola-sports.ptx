  <title>Parabola in Sports</title>

    <p>
        In many sports, an object is "thrown": a ball, a discus, a hammer, a 
        javelin etc. A shot is "put", and the long jump may be considered as 
        "throwing one's own body" as far as possible. Often the goal is to 
        obtain the maximal distance, while sometimes a certain target must be 
        hit (e.g., in darts, golf, basketball). Let us concentrate on the former 
        situation here.
    </p>

    <p>
        By an <term>ideal projectile motion</term> we mean the motion of an 
        object (or <em>projectile</em>) that moves along the path under the 
        action of gravity only; the influence of friction, air drag or other 
        aerodynamical influences is not considered (although they, in reality, 
        play a significant role <mdash /> as we have seen in 
        <em>Digression 4: Throwing a Ball</em>).  
    </p>

    <p> 
        The following situation should sound familiar from what we have done 
        during the semester: We launch the projectile from the height <m>b</m> with an initial 
        velocity <m>v_0</m> at a launch angle <m>\alpha</m>. The horizontal and 
        vertical components of the initial velocity are then <m>v_0\,\cos(\alpha)</m> 
        and <m>v_0\,\sin(\alpha)</m>. There is only an acceleration in the vertical 
        direction, downwards, due to gravity, given by <m>-g</m> where <m>g</m> is the 
        acceleration due to gravity on the surface of the earth (given by the value 
        <m>9.81 \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}^2}</m>). The minus sign in <m>-g</m> signifies that the 
        acceleration is downwards (towards the center of the Earth). Since the 
        acceleration is the time derivative of the velocity, integration yields 
        that horizontal velocity remains unchanged at <m>v_0\,\cos(\alpha)</m>, 
        while the vertical velocity changes linearly as time progresses according 
        to <m>v_0\,\sin(\alpha) - g\cdot t</m>. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Integrating the horizontal and vertical velocities again with respect 
        to the time <m>t</m>, yields the horizontal and vertical 
        <term>displacements</term> at time <m>t</m>. The horizontal displacement is given by
        <me>x(t) = v_0\,\cos(\alpha)\cdot t,</me>
        while the vertical displacement <mdash/>taking the initial height <m>b</m> 
        into account <mdash/> is given by 
        <me>y(t) = v_0\,\sin(\alpha)\cdot t - \frac12 g\cdot t^2 + b.</me>
    </p>

    <p>
        Let us explore this projectile motion now in Python/SageMath: We define a function 
        <code>f</code> that has arguments <code>v0</code>, <code>alpha</code> and <code>t</code> 
        as well as <code>b</code> (the last one with a default value of <code>0</code>). 
        It should return the tuple <code>(x,y)</code>, i.e., the <m>x</m>- and 
        <m>y</m>-coordinates of the projectile at time <m>t</m>. Note that cosine and 
        sine take angles in radians not degrees, so if you want to measure your angles in 
        degrees you have to multiply <m>\alpha</m> by a factor of <m>\frac{\pi}{180}</m> 
        in the above formulae.
    </p>

    <p>
        We can now explore the motion of your projectile for different values of 
        <code>v0</code> and <code>alpha</code> (we let <code>b=0</code> for the moment). 
        You can plot the path your projectile will take by using a <code>parametric_plot</code>. 
        We fix a value of <m>v_0</m> and then by varying the value of <m>\alpha</m> find the angle 
        where we obtain the maximal horizontal range (i.e., we find the value of $x(t)$ where we 
        have $y(t)=0$, i.e., where the projectile returned to the <m>x</m>-axis). 
    </p>

    <p> 
        <sage>
            <input>
            g = 9.81
            def f(t,v0,alpha,b=0):
                return (v0*cos(pi*alpha/180)*t, v0*sin(pi*alpha/180)*t - g*t^2/2 + b)

            show(sum([parametric_plot(f(x,10,5*i),(x,0,2),ymin=0,
                aspect_ratio=1,color=hue(i/20),
                legend_label=("%d degrees" % (5*i))) for i in 
                range(18,-1,-1)]),xmax=11,figsize=10)
            </input>
        </sage>
        The picture above shows the parabolic paths of projectiles 
        with the same initial velocity <code>v0=10</code> but different angles 
        (in steps of <m>5^{\circ}</m>). What distance do you get for which 
        throwing angle <m>\alpha</m>?
    </p>

	<p>
		You should see that for a projectile to hit the ground (i.e., <m>y=0</m>) 
        at a certain distance, you either have none, one or 
        two<fn xml:id="artillery">In military science, the two possibilites are 
        called <em>direct fire</em> and <em>plunging fire</em>. In many of the (early) 
        <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery_game">Artillery-style computer games</a> 
        the player(s) had to use plunging fire to be vitorious.</fn> angles for a 
        given initial velocity (there is only one angle to achieve the maximal distance).   
	</p>

	<p>
		In the above formula, we can make <m>t</m> the subject in 
		<me>x = v_0\,\cos(\alpha)\cdot t,</me>
	    and then plug this into the formula for <m>y</m> to obtain
		<me> y = - \frac{g}{2\,v_0^2\,\cos^2(\alpha)}\,x^2+\tan(\alpha)\,x+b.</me>
		Clearly, the right-hand side is a quadratic polynomial in <m>x</m>, 
        and therefore the function <m>y</m> (now a function of <m>x</m> instead of <m>t</m>) is 
        therefore indeed a parabola. So, alternatively to the above 
        <code>parametric_plot</code>, you can also do a normal <code>plot</code> 
        using this function <mdash/> with the same result.
        <sage>
            <input>
            g = 9.81
            def f(x,v0,alpha,b=0):
                return - g/(2*v0^2*cos(pi*alpha/180)^2)*x^2+tan(pi*alpha/180)*x+b

            show(sum([plot(f(x,10,5*i),(x,0,11),ymin=0,
                aspect_ratio=1,color=hue(i/20),
                legend_label=("%d degrees" % (5*i))) for i in 
                range(17,-1,-1)]),ymin=0,figsize=10)           
            </input>
        </sage>
	</p>

	<p>
		Furthermore, we can now easily calculate the <term>horizontal range</term>, 
        i.e., the value of <m>x</m> (greater than <m>0</m>) where the projectile 
        returned to the <m>x</m>-axis (that is, where we have <m>y=0</m>): 
        This is amounts to solving the quadratic equation 
		<me> 0 = - \frac{g}{2\,v_0^2\,\cos^2(\alpha)}\,x^2+\tan(\alpha)\,x+b.</me>
		for <m>x</m> and only considering the positive <mdash/> larger <mdash/> root. Remember 
        that we have done something like this in one of the quizzes? 
	</p>

	<p>
		The formula that one obtains for the horizontal range <m>x_r</m> is
		<me>x_r=\frac{v_0^2}{g}\,\cos(\alpha)\left(\sin(\alpha)+\sqrt{\sin^2(\alpha)+\frac{2\,g\,b}{v_0^2}}\right).</me>
		For <m>b=0</m> this reduces to (using trig identities)
		<me>x_r= \frac{v_0^2}{g}\,\sin(2\alpha),</me>
		and thus we obtain the maximal horizontal range <m>\frac{v_0^2}{g}</m> 
        for the angle <m>\alpha=45^{\circ}</m>. Note that the initial velocity 
        <m>v_0</m> enters quadratically in this maximal range <mdash/> this is 
        the reason why athletes practice so much to achieve their maximal 
        "push" at the moment they are realeasing the object they are throwing!
	</p>

	<p>
		If the initial height <m>b</m> is not zero, then one can find the maximal 
        horizontal range and the optimal angle by differentiating the above expression 
        for <m>x_r</m> with respect to <m>\alpha</m>, setting it equal to zero and 
        solving the equation obtained. Without going through the steps here, the 
        maximal horizontal range <m>x_{\max}</m> is then given by
		<me>x_{\max} = \frac{v_0^2}{g}\,\sqrt{1+\frac{2\,g\,b}{v_0^2}}.</me>
		The optimal angle <m>\alpha_{\max}</m> to obtain this maximal horizontal range is 
		<me>\cos(2\alpha_{\max}) = \frac{g\,b}{v_0^2+g\,b},</me>
		or
		<me>\alpha_{\max} = \frac12\,\arccos\left(\frac{g\,b}{v_0^2+g\,b}\right).</me>
		(Again note, the the angle here is given in radians, so you might want to 
        multiply this result by <m>\frac{180}{\pi}</m> to obtain degrees.)
	</p>

	<p>
		Let us explore these formulae:
		<ul>
			<li>Check that for a fixed value <m>b\gt 0</m> the optimal angle 
            <m>\alpha_{\max}</m> is an increasing function in <m>v_0</m>, 
            but also less than <m>45^{\circ}</m> with 
            <m>\lim\limits_{v_0\to+\infty} \alpha_{\max} = 45^{\circ}</m> 
            (so, only for high velocities the optimal angle is close to 
            <m>45^{\circ}</m>.</li>
			<li>Check that for a given initial velocity <m>v_0</m>, 
            the optimal angle <m>\alpha_{\max}</m> is a descreasing function 
            in <m>b</m> (with <m>\alpha_{\max}=45^{\circ}</m> for <m>b=0</m>).</li>
			<li>Also, fix a value of <m>b\gt 0</m>, and plot <m>x_{\max}</m> as a 
            function of <m>v_0</m>. Do you observe that <mdash/> except for very 
            small values of <m>v_0</m> <mdash/> this function is essentially a 
            quadratic function? So again, the initial velocity <m>v_0</m> 
            enters quadratically in the maximal range.</li>
		</ul>     
	</p>

	<p>
		Due to athlete's technique and muscular system, aerodynamic effects on the object etc., 
        the optimal angles will actually differ from the above optimal formula <mdash/> 
        achieving a higher initial velocity is usually better than achieving the exact 
        optimal angle. Measured values for different sports can be found in the following table:
