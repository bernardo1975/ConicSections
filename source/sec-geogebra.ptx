    <p> 
	    You find the conic sections (after possibly scrolling down and selecting "MORE") 
		in its own section on <a href="https://www.geogebra.org/calculator">GeoGebra</a>:

		If you downloaded GeoGebra and use it locally on your computer, you find the 
		conic sections in the following tool menu in GeoGebra (the seventh from the left):

	<p>
		There are four conic section tools under this menu: One for each of the conic sections 
        <em>ellipse</em>, <em>parabola</em> and <em>hyperbola</em>, and a general tool called 
        <em>conic through 5 points</em>. The last one is the actual icon for GeoGebra!

	    <em>Circles</em> are special case of conic sections. The tools dealing with circles 
        can be found in the tool menu to the left/above of conic sections.
	</p>

		It is probably the easiest to create a GeoGebra file for each of the three conic 
		sections <mdash /> although you can also do it in one file and then use 
		<em>check boxes</em> or <em>buttons</em> (like we learnt in the course) to show 
		one construction while hiding the others. Even if you create separate GeoGebra 
		files for each conic section, you should use <em>check boxes</em>, 
		<em>buttons</em>, etc. to show/hide the different tasks and constructions for each 
		of them.
