		There are four conic section tools under this menu: One for each of the conic sections 
        <em>ellips</em>, <em>parabola</em> and <em>hyperbola</em>, and a general tool called 
        <em>conic through 5 points</em>. The last one is the actual icon for GeoGebra!

        can be found in the tool menu to the left of conic sections.
