  <title>Interstellar Visitor</title>

  <p>
    On 19 October 2017, the <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-STARRS">Pan-STARRS</url> 
    1 telescope in Hawai`i picked up a faint point of light moving across the sky. Initially thought 
    to be a comet, it was reclassified as an asteroid a week later <mdash /> and astronomers got more 
    and more exciting about this object. The <url href="https://www.iau.org/">International Astronomical 
    Union</url> even introduced a new designation, "<em>I</em>", for this astronomical object. 
    Read about it in the following articles:

    Read (some) of the above articles and summarize in a short paragraph how the scientists know that the observed asteriod is an interstellar object.
