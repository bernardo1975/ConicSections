  <title>Parabola in GeoGebra</title>

    <p>
        In GeoGebra, we construct a parabola by choosing a point, called the <term>focus</term>, 
        together with a line, the <term>directrix</term>. Among other things, we will discuss 
        the significance of these two objects here, but let us first construct a parabola: 
        While you can choose any point and line (no matter of what slope), it might be useful 
        to choose a point <m>F</m> on the <m>y</m>-axis as focus and the <m>x</m>-axis as directrix.
    </p>

	<image source="parabola1.png"/>

	<p>
		We first explore how this construction and the quadratic equation <m>y=\alpha x^2+c</m> 
        with some parameters <m>\alpha</m> and <m>c</m> are related: Check that the vertex 
        (i.e., the extremal point, thus the minimum or maximum) of the parabola is given by 
        the midpoint between the origin and the focus <m>F</m>. Can you express the constant 
        <m>c</m> in terms of <m>y</m>-coordinate of <m>F</m>? Can you also express the parameter 
        <m>\alpha</m> in terms of <m>y</m>-coordinate of <m>F</m>?
	</p>

	<p>
		This shows that the parameters in the quadratic equation <m>y=\alpha x^2+c</m> 
        (or any quadratic equation describing a parabola) can be easily calculated 
        from the location of <m>F</m> in relation to the directrix. However, we can make 
        the geometrical relation between focus, directrix and parabola even more concrete.
	</p> 

	<p>
		We have just seen that the vertex of the parabola has the property that it has its 
        distance to the focus <m>F</m> is the same as its distance to the directrix. We now 
        check that this is true for any point <m>P</m> <strong>on</strong> the parabola: 
        Attach a point <m>P</m> to the parabola, and check that the distance <m>FP</m> 
        and the distance from <m>P</m> to the directrix (your <m>x</m>-axis) is the same.
	</p>

	<p>Underlying this observation is the following geometrical definition of the parabola.</p>

    <definition xml:id="def-parabola">
        <p>A <term>parabola</term> is the <term>equidistant set</term> (or <term>midset</term>) 
        to a fixed point (the <em>focus</em>) and a line (the <em>directrix</em>) not 
        containing this point; i.e., the parabola is the 
        <term>locus</term><fn xml:id="def-locus">A <term>locus</term> is a set of points 
        whose location is determined by one or more specified conditions. For the parabola, 
        this condition is the equal distance to the focus and the directrix.</fn> of those 
        points <m>(x,y)</m> in the plane that have the same distance from the focus and the 
        directrix.</p>
    </definition>  

    <p>
        Let us explain this result in different words.
        You are properly familiar with the <term>perpendicular bisector</term> of a line 
        joining two points <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>: Any of the points on the bisector has 
        the same distance from the point <m>A</m> as it has from the point <m>B</m>. If 
        you replace one of these two points, say <m>B</m>, with a straight line (not 
        passing through <m>A</m>), you can ask the same question again: Which points in 
        the plane have the same distance to <m>A</m> as they have to the line? The answer 
        is: All points of the parabola that has <m>A</m> as focus and the line as its directrix.
    </p>

    <p>
        How different are parabolas from each other? Maybe you remember the following 
        SageMath code where we plotted a regular parabola and a skinny one:

        <sage>
            <input>
            regular = plot(x^2,(x,-2,2),color="purple")
			skinny = plot(4*x^2,(x,-2,2),color="darkgreen")
			regular + skinny
            </input>
        </sage>

        Despite this, we will now check that all parabolas are <em>similar</em> to 
        each other: Given any two parabolas, you can translate and rotate one of them 
        such that its directrix coincides with the directrix of the other one. What you 
        end up with is the following situation of two parabolas: One we already have 
        with focus <m>F</m>, and another one with a different focus, let us say 
        <m>G</m>, both foci on the <m>y</m>-axis. So, construct this second 
        parabola with focus <m>G</m> on the <m>y-</m>-axis. Then using the 
        <em>dilate from point</em> tool (from which point? by which factor?), 
        show that one of the parabolas is just a scaled copy of the other.
    </p>

	<p>
		So, all parabolas are <em>similar</em> to each other <mdash /> 
        they all have the <em>same shape</em>!
    </p>  

    <p>
        We now consider the original parabola with focus <m>F</m> and point 
        <m>P</m> on it again. Find the tangent <m>t</m> to the parabola at 
        <m>P</m>, the line <m>p</m> that is perpendicular to the directrix and 
        passes through <m>P</m>, and the segment <m>f</m> joining <m>F</m> and 
        <m>P</m>. Measure the angle at <m>P</m> between <m>p</m> and the tangent 
        <m>t</m>, and the angle between <m>f</m> and the tangent <m>t</m>, and make 
        note of your observation as you move <m>P</m> along the parabola (hint: 
        you might consider adding additional points on the lines to measure the 
        angles nicely <mdash/> then hide the points again). 
    </p>

	<p>
		With the observation you just made, you should now be able to understand 
        the following explanation for 
        <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabolic_reflector">parabolic mirrors</url> 
        used in reflecting telescopes, flashlights, and car headlights: In an astronomical 
        telescope, parallel rays of light coming into a parabolic mirror are focused at a 
        point <m>F</m>. This is due to the laws of optics since a ray of light is reflected 
        on the parabolic surface of the mirror according to the rule that the incoming angle 
        equals the outgoing angle of the ray (which is the observation we just made). For 
        flashlights and car headlights the ray of lights go the other way: the bulb is 
        located at the focus <m>F</m> and when turned on, parallel <mdash/> and thus bundled 
        <mdash/> rays of light leave the parabolic reflector.
	</p>

	<p>
		Finally, we have some fun with the osculating circle. Find the 
        <em>osculating circle</em> to the parabola at the point <m>P</m> 
        (you can either go through the construction we did earlier in the semester, 
        or there is also a convenient GeoGebra command that will draw the it). Also 
        find the the center <m>M</m> of the osculating circle. By construction, line 
        passing through <m>M</m> and <m>P</m> is the <em>normal</em> to the parabola at 
        <m>P</m>, i.e., the line perpendicular to the tangent <m>t</m> to the parabola at 
        <m>P</m>. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Instead of the whole normal line that passes through <m>M</m> and <m>P</m> here, 
        we only draw a ray originating from <m>P</m> and passing through <m>M</m>.
	</p>

	<image source="parabola4.png"/>

	<p>
		Now, let us concentrate on this <em>normal</em> (hide most of the other stuff): 
        Select "Trace On" in its properties (right-click on it), and then move the point 
        <m>P</m> fairly fast across the parabola. Your picture should look something like 
        this:
	</p>

	<image source="images/parabola5.png"/>

	<p>
		Do you see a kind of curve appearing in the above picture?
	    If you are not satisfied with your outcome and want another try, then go to 
        "Refresh View" in the "View" menu.
	</p>

	<p>
		Now, refresh the view, hide the normal, but show the center <m>M</m> 
        of the osculating circle <mdash/> and now check out what kind of curve 
        the point <m>M</m> "traces out" as you move <m>P</m> (very slowly this time) 
        along the parabola. This curve is called the <em>evolute</em>.
	</p>

	<definition xml:id="def-evolute">
		<p>
			The locus of all the centers of the osculating circles, is called the 
            <term>evolute</term> of the given curve.
		</p>
	</definition>
