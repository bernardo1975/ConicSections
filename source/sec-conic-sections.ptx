       	<p>A <term>conic section</term> is a curve obtained by the intersection 
        of the surface of a circular cone and a plane (not passing through the 
        vertex, also called the <term>apex</term>, of the cone).</p>

		If the cone is cut by a plane that has the same slope as the cone (see 
        picture above), then the intersection is a <term>parabola</term>; if 
        the slope of the plane is less steep, then the intersection is an 
        <term>ellipse</term> (and, as special case, if the plane is horizontal, 
        a <term>circle</term>); and if the slope of the plane is steeper, then 
        the intersection is a <term>hyperbola</term>.

		Since the circular cone can be described as the set of points 
        <m>(x, y, z)</m> in three-dimensional space that satisfy  
        <me>x^2+y^2=\alpha\,z^2</me> for an appropriate <m>\alpha>0</m> 
        (and we note that <m>\arctan(\alpha)</m> is the slope of the cone), 
        one can check that all these conic sections can be described as points 
        <m>(x,y)</m> in the plane that satisfy some quadratic equation 
        <me>a x^2+b xy+c y^2+d x+e y+f=0</me> for some appropriate constants 
        <m>a, b, c, d, e, f</m>; in fact, by choosing the coordinate system 
        appropriately (i.e., by rotating and translating the curves here 
        appropriately, i.e., by looking at a <em>congruent copy</em> of the curve), 
        we actually only<fn xml:id="footnote-degenerate-conic">We are discarding 
        cases here where the quadratic equation reduces to equations of lines, 
        or yields only a point or even the empty set (i.e., has no solution) 
        or the whole plane.</fn> have to consider the three equations 
        <me>\alpha x^2+\beta y^2=1</me> which describes an ellipse, 
        <me>\alpha x^2-\beta y^2=1</me> which describes a hyperbola, 
        and <me>\alpha x^2=y</me> which describes a parabola, for some 
        positive constants <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m>. While this 
        classification with respect to quadratic equations is useful, 
        there other <mdash /> more geometrical <mdash /> ways to describe 
        these curves.

		In this project, we will look at the geometry of conic sections 
        using GeoGebra. We are interested in their geometrical properties, 
        properties they share and that distinguish them from each other. 
        We will then explore their applications in physics, astronomy and 
        other technical fields using Python and SageMath.
