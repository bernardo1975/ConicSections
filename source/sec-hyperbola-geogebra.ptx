  <title>Hyperbola in GeoGebra</title>

  <p>
    In GeoGebra, we construct a hyperbola similar to the ellipse, i.e., we first choose 
    two points, called the <term>foci</term> <m>F_1</m> and <m>F_2</m>, together with a 
    point on the hyperbola. We will thus proceed similar to the last section. In particular, 
    it might be useful to choose the two foci <m>F_1</m> and <m>F_2</m> to lie on the 
    <m>x</m>-axis symmetrically around the origin. Again, the third point <m>A</m> through 
    which the hyperbola passes is only needed if we want to change the hyperbola. We note 
    that the hyperbola actually consists of two curves, called the two <term>branches</term> 
    of the hyperbola.
  </p>

  <p>
    We use the same vocabulary as for ellipses: The midpoint between the two foci is called 
    the <term>center</term> of the hyperbola. The intersection of the line through the foci 
    and the hyperbola yield the two <term>vertices</term> of the hyperbola. We denote the 
    distance from the center to a focus by <m>c</m>, and the distance from the center to a 
    vertex by <m>a</m> (note that <m>c\gt a</m> while for the ellipse we had <m>c\lt a</m>). 
    If you constructed your hyperbola symmetrically around the origin, your foci should be 
    have coordinates <m>(-c,0)</m> and <m>(c,0)</m>, the center is at the origin <m>(0,0)</m> 
    and the vertices have coordinates <m>(-a,0)</m> and <m>(a,0)</m>. As before, we call 
    <m>a</m> the (length of) the <term>semi-major axis</term> and <m>c</m> the 
    <term>linear eccentricity</term>. 
  </p>

	<p>
    We calculate, respectively construct, a number <m>b</m> by <m>c^2=a^2+b^2</m>, i.e., 
    <m>b=\pm\sqrt{c^2-a^2}</m>. Constructively, we get the number <m>b</m> by drawing a 
    circle of radius <m>c</m> around the center (this circle will therefore pass through 
    <m>F_1</m> and <m>F_2</m>). The perpendicular line through one of the vertices, say 
    the one with coordinates <m>(a,0)</m> on the right, will intersect this circle at 
    the points <m>(a,b)</m> and <m>(a,-b)</m> (similarly, the the perpendicular line 
    through the other vertex will yield the two points <m>(-a,b)</m> and <m>(-a,-b)</m> 
    of intersection with this circle). Now draw the two lines passing through the center 
    (i.e., the origin <m>(0,0)</m> here) and one of these points of intersection we just 
    constructed here (they are the two black dash-diotted lines in the above picture): 
    Can you figure out what their significance is?
  </p>

  <p>
    Let us look at a geometrical definition of the hyperbola: Attach a point <m>P</m> 
    to the ellipse, and measure the distances <m>F_1P</m> and <m>F_2P</m>. Observe that 
    as you move <m>P</m> around the ellipse, the <em>difference</em> of the two distances 
    is constant. How is this difference related to the length <m>a</m>?
  </p>

  <definition xml:id="def-hyperbola1">
    <p>A <term>hyperbola</term> is the locus of those points of the plane whose difference 
    of distances to two fixed points <m>F_1</m> and <m>F_2</m> (the two <term>foci</term> 
    of the hyperbola) is constant.</p>
  </definition>

	<p>
		The <term>eccentricity</term> <m>e</m> of the hyperbola is given by <m>\frac{c}{a}</m>, 
    i.e., the ratio of the linear eccentricity to the semi-major axis. Since <m>c\gt a</m> 
    for a hyperbola, we have that the eccentricity is <m>e\gt 1</m> for any hyperbola. 
    One can now proceed <mdash/> as we did for ellipses <mdash/> and construct a 
    <term>directrix</term> for (each branch of) the hyperbola, and thus obtain a second 
    geometrical definition of the hyperbola. However, we will skip this construction here. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Instead we will look at the definition of the hyperbola as an <em>equidistant set</em>. 
    To this end, construct a circle around a vertex passing through its nearest focus, 
    say <m>F_1</m>. Intersecting this circle with the major axis (i.e., the <m>x</m>-axis here) 
    will give two points, namely, the focus <m>F_1</m> itself and a point we call <m>D</m> here. 
    Now find the circle around the other focus <m>F_2</m> passing through the point <m>D</m> 
    (note that the other focus <m>F_1</m> is outside this circle), and check that the circle 
    around <m>P</m> passing through <m>F_1</m> will always touch the previous circle in 
    exactly one point (called <m>I</m> in the next picture) no matter where <m>P</m> is 
    located on (the branch closest to <m>F_1</m> of) the hyperbola. We thus have arrived 
    at another geometrical definition of the hyperbola that you should be able to complete 
    by yourself now.

  <definition xml:id="def-hyperbola3">
    <p>A branch of the <term>hyperbola</term> is the <term>equidistant set</term> 
      (or <term>midset</term>) to <m>\ldots</m></p>
  </definition>

	<p>
		We now only consider the hyperbola with the two foci <m>F_1</m> and <m>F_2</m> 
    together with a point <m>P</m> on one of the branches of the hyperbola. Construct 
    the tangent <m>t</m> to the hyperbola at <m>P</m>. We could again measure angles now 
    (and would get similar results as before for the parabola and the ellipse), but let us 
    look at something else here: the perpendicular line to the tangent through the point 
    <m>P</m> is called the <term>normal</term>. Get a slider with non-negative numbers, e.g., 
    on the interval from <m>0</m> to <m>10</m> (or <m>15</m>). Use the number from the slider, 
    call it <m>r</m>, as radius of a circle around <m>P</m>, and find the points of intersection 
    of this circle and the normal. In the following picture, these points of intersection are 
    called <m>S</m> and <m>T</m>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Using <m>S</m> and <m>T</m>, we can now draw curves that are <term>parallel</term> to a 
    branch of the hyperbola: Set your radius <m>r</m> to a certain value, then turn the 
    "Trace on" for the point <m>S</m> and/or <m>T</m>, and slowly move <m>P</m> along the 
    branch of the hyperbola. The points you trace out here, all have distance <m>r</m> 
    from the branch of the hyperbola and thus are on parallel curves to that branch. If 
    you do this carefully for different values of <m>r</m>, you will get a picture as below: 
    To the outside of the branch of the hyperbola, you get the (green) curves that you 
    should have expected, however, on the inside something more exciting is happening! 
    From a certain value of <m>r</m> onwards, the curves we are getting have "kinks". 
    Draw a couple of curves for different values of <m>r</m> <mdash/> make a screenshot 
    of your favorite picture you got here!

	<p>
		Let us now return to a construction we also did for the parabola, namely, finding 
    the <term>evolute</term> of (a branch of) the hyperbola. So, find the osculating 
    circle to the hyperbola at the point <m>P</m>. Then find the midpoint <m>M</m> of 
    that osculating circle. And finally "trace" out the curve this center <m>M</m> 
    moves about as you move the <m>P</m> along the (branch of the) hyperbola. This is 
    the <term>evolute</term>. Does the curve you are getting here look familiar?
