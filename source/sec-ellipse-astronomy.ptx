  <title>Ellipse in Astronomy</title>

    <p>
        Based on <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tycho_Brahe">Tycho Brahe's</url> 
        excellently accurate and comprehensive astronomical and planetary observations, 
        <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler">Johannes Kepler</url> 
        formulated the three 
        <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion">Kepler's 
        laws of planetary motion</url> between 1609 and 1619:
        <ol>
            <li>The orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci.</li>
            <li>A line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.</li>
            <li>The square of the orbital period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit.</li>
        </ol>
        The first two laws are contained in his book <url href=""><em>Astronomia Nova</em></url> ("New Astronomy"), 
        published in 1609, based on Tycho Brahe's accurate observations of 
        Mars<fn xml:id="mars-eccentricity">Mars coincidentally has the second highest 
        eccentricity (<m>e=0.0934</m>) of all planets after Mercury (<m>e=0.2056</m>).</fn>, 
        while the third law is contained in his book 
        <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonices_Mundi"><em>Harmonices Mundi</em></url> 
        ("The Harmony of the World"), published in 1619. 
        <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton">Sir Isaac Newton</url> obtained a 
        theoretical explanation of Kepler's laws of motion of the planets based on his three laws of 
        motion <mdash/> the basis of classical mechanics <mdash/> in his work 
        <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophi%C3%A6_Naturalis_Principia_Mathematica"><em>Philosophi√¶ Naturalis Principia Mathematica</em></url> 
        ("Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy"), published in 1687.
    </p>

    <p>
        The first law is a statement about the shape of the orbit, an ellipse, and that 
        the sun is contained at one of the two foci, while the second law is a statement 
        about the speed with which the planet moves around on the orbit. They improve the 
        previous model<fn xml:id="Copernicus-ref">Copernicus' model is published in his 
        book <em>De revolutionibus orbium coelestium</em> ("On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres") 
        in 1543.</fn> by <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus">Nicolaus Copernicus</url> 
        where a planetry orbits is a circle with the Sun at the center on which the planet moves 
        with constant speed. The third law compares different planets to each other since it captures 
        the relationship between the distance of planets from the Sun, and their orbital periods. 
        We will look at the first and second law here.
    </p>

    <p>
        The first law places the Sun at one of the foci of an ellipse which is the orbit 
        of the planet. Mathematically, it is therefore useful to place one of the foci of 
        the ellipse at the origin of the coordinate system, and, in fact, use 
        <em>polar coordinates</em> to represent an ellipse. The formula of an ellipse in 
        polar coordinates <m>(r,\theta)</m> (i.e., with radial coordinate <m>r</m> and 
        angular coordinate <m>\theta</m>)
        <me> r = \frac{\ell}{1+e\,\cos(\theta)} </me>
        where <m>e</m> is the <term>eccentricity</term> and <m>\ell</m> is the 
        <term>semi-lactus rectum</term> of the ellipse (we explain the latter shortly). 
        For the orbit of the Earth, one has <m>e=0.0167086</m>, a value close to zero 
        and thus Earth's orbit is almost a circle, and <m>\ell = 149\,555\,000</m>km. 
        Using SageMath and <code>polar_plot</code> we can plot an accurate picture of 
        the shape of Earth's orbit (the units on the axes are million km):
        <sage>
            <input>
            polar_plot(149.555/(1+0.0167086*cos(x)),(x,0,2*pi))
            </input>
        </sage>
        The <term>latus rectum</term> is the <term>chord</term><fn xml:id="term-chord">A 
        <term>chord</term> is a line segment joining two points on any curve, e.g., on 
        the ellipse.</fn> parallel to the directrix (and thus prependicular to the major axis) 
        and passing through one of the two foci; half of its length is called 
        <term>semi-lactus rectum</term> which is therefore the distance from the foci 
        to the point on the ellipse.  
    </p>

	<image source="latusrectum.png"/>

	<p>
		We note that from the eccentricity <m>e</m> and the semi-lactus rectum 
        <m>\ell</m> one can calculate all the other parameters of the ellipse: 
        The semi-major axis is given by <m>a=\frac{\ell}{1-e^2}</m>, the semi-minor 
        axis is given by <m>b=\frac{\ell}{\sqrt{1-e^2}}</m>, the linear eccentricity 
        is given by <m>c=e\cdot\frac{\ell}{1-e^2}</m> etc. (in fact, given any two 
        quantities, one can calculate the others).
	</p>

	<p>
		Two points on a planetary orbit are of particular interest: The 
        <term>perihelion</term> is the point on the orbit that is closest to the 
        Sun, while the <term>aphelion</term> is the point that is farthest from the Sun. 
        In polar coordinates they are located at <m>\theta=0^{\circ}</m> and 
        <m>\theta=180^{\circ}</m>, respectively.
        <sage>
            <input>
            polar_plot(1/(1+0.5*cos(x)),(x,0,2*pi))+point((0,0),size=35)+point((2/3,0),size=35)+point((-2,0),size=35)+text("Sun",(0,.1),fontsize='large',color='black')+text("Perhelion",(2/3,.1),fontsize='large',color='black')+text("Aphelion",(-2,.1),fontsize='large',color='black')
            </input>
        </sage>
        One can therefore easily calculate the distances:
        <ul>
            <li>the distance Sun to perhelion is <m>\frac{\ell}{1+e}</m>, and</li>
            <li>the distance Sun to aphelion is <m>\frac{\ell}{1-e}</m>.</li>
        </ul>
        Perihelion and aphelion are sometimes incorrectly used for the orbits of objects 
        about bodies other than the Sun. The general terms for orbits around any center 
        of mass (not just the Sun) are <term>periapsis</term> and <term>apoapsis</term>, 
        respectively.
	</p>

	<p>
		Some people <em>wrongly</em> believe that the seasons are due to this varying 
        distance of the Earth to the Sun <mdash/> this is not the case. The seasons 
        are due to the Earth's axial tilt<fn xml:id="fn-Earth-tilt">Earth's tilt
        is also the reason for the <term>tropics</term> being between 
        <m>23.43696^{\circ}</m>S and <m>23.43696^{\circ}</m>N, and the 
        <term>polar circles</term> at <m>66.56304^{\circ}</m>S and 
        <m>66.56304^{\circ}</m>N, respectively. </fn> of <m>23.43696^{\circ}</m>, which is the 
        angle between the plane that contains the orbit of the Earth around the Sun 
        and the plane through the equator of the Earth. By the <em>conversation of 
        angular momentum</em> this tilt (essentially) stays the same as the Earth 
        wanders around the Sun, thus the solstices (the shortest and longest day 
        of the year around June 21st and December 21st) and the equinoxes (the days 
        where night time and daylight have equal length all over Earth around March 
        21st and September 23rd) occur on specific points on Earth's orbit. the 
        following picture shows the relationship between the perhelion (periapsis), 
        the aphelion (apoapsis) and the seasonal dates (this picture is taken from 
        <url href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/Seasons1.svg">here</url>).
	</p>

	<image source="Seasons1.svg"/>

	<p>
		As you can in this picture the perihelion (periapsis) falls on January 3rd, 
        and thus almost on the winter solstice (December 21st). If the two events 
        would coincide, then the two equinoxes would be given by the points on the 
        ellipse connected by the latus rectum; in other words, in that case the 
        equinoxes would be given by the points where the ellipse crosses the 
        <m>y</m>-axis in the first SageMath picture we plotted above. To make 
        some of the calculations easier below, we will pretend that the two 
        solstices coincide with the perihelion and the aphelion, respectively.
	</p>

	<p>
		Let us now look at Kepler's second law, the statement about the speed 
        of a planet around the Sun. It states that the "area speed" is constant. 
        In equal times, the segment connecting the focus with the planet will 
        sweep out equal areas <mdash/> and thus close to the perihelion the 
        planet will move faster than close to the aphelion (i.e., the closer 
        the planet is to the Sun, the faster it moves).
	</p>

	<image source="Kepler2.png"/>

	<p>
		Can we calculate these areas? Luckily yes, and for this the above polar 
        form of the ellipse is helpful again. Recall that areas can be calculated 
        using integrals, so what integral do we have to calculate here? If you 
        look at a very small angle <m>\varDelta\theta</m>, the area the 
        corresponding segment sweeps out is approximately a circular sector 
        of radius <m>r</m> and thus has area 
		<me>\frac12\,r^2\,\varDelta\theta = \frac12\,\left(\frac{\ell}{1+e\cos(\theta)}\right)\cdot \varDelta\theta</me> 
		Changing this now to an integral, the area swept out by travelling 
        from polar angle <m>\theta_1</m> to polar angle <m>\theta_2</m> 
        (measured with the focus at the origin) is 
		<me>\frac12\int\limits_{\theta_1}^{\theta_2} \left(\frac{\ell}{1+e\,\cos(\theta)}\right)^2\,\operatorname{d}\!\theta .</me>					
		SageMath can find the anti-derivative of 
        <m> \frac12\int \left(\frac{\ell}{1+e\,\cos(\theta)}\right)^2\,\operatorname{d}\!\theta</m>:
        <sage>
            <input>
			e, theta, l = var('e, theta, l')
			assume(1-e^2>0)
			((1/2)*integrate((l/(1+e*cos(theta)))^2,theta)).show()                    	
			</input>
            <output>
            l^2*(e*sin(theta)/((e^3 + e^2 - e - (e^3 - e^2 - e + 1)*sin(theta)^2/(cos(theta) + 1)^2 - 1)*(cos(theta) + 1)) + arctan((e - 1)*sin(theta)/(sqrt(-e^2 + 1)*(cos(theta) + 1)))/((e^2 - 1)*sqrt(-e^2 + 1)))
            </output>
        </sage>
        However, we will use the command <code>numerical_integral</code> to explore 
        Kepler's second law further. If you use <code>numerical_integral</code> to 
        evaluate integrals numerically, SageMath will return two numbers: The 
        calculated numerical value of the integral, and the possible error made 
        by calculating the integral not exact but by some numerical method. We 
        will only be interested in the first number here.
	</p>

	<p>
		It takes the Earth <m>365.256363004</m> days to orbit once around the Sun 
        (i.e., approximately, <m>365\frac14</m> days, and therefore we have a leap 
        year every <m>4</m> years). Thus, on average, we expect that it takes the 
        Earth slightly more than a day (namely, 
        <m>\frac{365.256\ldots}{360}\approx 1.0146\ldots = 1\ \text{day}\ 21</m> 
        minutes) to sweep out an elliptical sector of center angle <m>1^{\circ}</m>. 
        However, near the perihelion the Earth will move faster than average, so it 
        sweeps out such an angle of <m>1^{\circ}</m> in less time, while near the 
        aphelion the Earth will move slower and thus it will need more time to sweep 
        out this angle. 
	</p>

	<p>
		We first calculate the total area of an ellipse with the same eccentricity 
        than Earth's orbit (the semi-lactus rectum enters as a quadratic factor 
        <m>\ell^2</m>, thus we can simply set it equal to one for the moment).
        <sage>
            <input>
			numerical_integral((1/2)*1/(1+0.016710219*cos(x))^2,0,2*pi)                    	
			</input>
            <output>
            (3.142908960083767, 3.489329891785705e-14)
            </output>
        </sage>
 		Since it is almost a circle, we almost get the value of <m>\pi</m> here; 
        the possible error is around <m>3\cdot 10^{-14}</m> and thus we can 
        certainly trust this numerical calculation. The exact result is
 		<me>\pi\cdot a\cdot b = \frac{\pi\cdot \ell^2}{(\sqrt{1-e^2})^3} = \frac{\pi\cdot\ell^2}{(\sqrt{1-0.016710219^2})^3}</me>
 		giving the same value.
 	</p>

 	<p>
 		We now calculate how long it takes the Earth to travel <m>1^{\circ}</m> on 
        its orbit, and then plot the result:
        <sage>
            <input>
			totalarea = numerical_integral((1/2)*1/(1+0.016710219*cos(x))^2,0,2*pi)[0]
			datalist = [(365.256363004/totalarea)*numerical_integral((1/2)*1/(1+0.016710219*cos(x))^2,i*2*pi/360,(i+1)*2*pi/360)[0] for i in range(360)] 
			list_plot(datalist, axes_labels=["angle","days"]) + plot(365.256363004/360,(x,0,360),linestyle=":",color="black")                   	
			</input>
	    </sage>
	    As you can see, near the perihelion it takes the Earth less than a day to sweep out an elliptical sector with central angle of <m>1^{\circ}</m> (close to <m>0.98\ \text{days}</m> which is <m>29</m> minutes short of a full day), while near the aphelion (in summer) we need around <m>1.05\ \text{days}\ = 1\ \text{day}\ 1\ \text{hour}\ 12</m> minutes for the same angle.   
	</p>

	<p>
		Let us look at another consequence of Earth's elliptical orbit: If Earth's 
        orbit would be a perfect circle, the two equinoxes would be exactly half a 
        year apart. In our approximation, the spring equinox happens at polar angle 
        <m>90^{\circ}</m>, while the autumn equinox happens at polar angle <m>270^{\circ}</m>. 
        So, the combined time for spring and summer is proportional to
		<me>\frac12\int\limits_{90^{\circ}}^{270^{\circ}} \left(\frac{\ell}{1+e\,\cos(\theta)}\right)^2\,\operatorname{d}\!\theta,</me>
		while the combined time for autumn and winter is propoportional to
		<me>\frac12\int\limits_{0^{\circ}}^{90^{\circ}} \left(\frac{\ell}{1+e\,\cos(\theta)}\right)^2\,\operatorname{d}\!\theta + \frac12\int\limits_{270^{\circ}}^{360^{\circ}} \left(\frac{\ell}{1+e\,\cos(\theta)}\right)^2\,\operatorname{d}\!\theta.</me>
		By this consideration, we find that spring and summer combined last a total of
        <sage>
            <input>
			totalarea = numerical_integral((1/2)*1/(1+0.016710219*cos(x))^2,0,2*pi)[0]
			springsummer = (365.256363004/totalarea)*numerical_integral((1/2)*1/(1+0.016710219*cos(x))^2,pi/2,3*pi/2)[0] 
			springsummer.n()                   	
			</input>
			<output>
			186.513618240123
			</output>
		</sage>
	    i.e., approximately <m>186\frac12</m> days. Correspondingly, autumn and winter 
        last then a total of <m>178\frac34</m> days, or approximately <m>7\frac34</m> 
        days less than spring and summer combined. Since the perihelion and the aphelion 
        don't fall on the solstices, we actually got one day too much here, but we can 
        acount for the <m>6\frac34</m> days as follows:
	    Since there are more months with <m>31</m> days during the spring-summer months and 
        winter also contains the short February, there are <m>2\frac34</m> less days 
        between September 21st and March 21st than the other way round; and since the 
        equinox falls on September 23rd (and not September 21st), we gain another <m>4</m> 
        days for the difference between the spring-summer part vs. the autumn-winter part of the year. 
	    So the small eccentricity of the Earth's orbit already makes a difference of 
        around a week when we maesure the time between subsequent equinoxes!
	</p>

<!--
					In our approximation, the equinoxes would happen at the endpoints of the <em>minor axis</em>. The center of the ellipse has coordinates (the mean value of the perihelion and the aphelion) 
					<me>\left(-\frac{e\cdot \ell}{1-e^2},0\right) ,</me>
					thus the endpoints of the minor axis (given that the length of the semi-minor axis is given by <m>b=\frac{\ell}{\sqrt{1-e^2}}</m>) have coordinates
					<me>\left(-\frac{e\cdot \ell}{1-e^2},\frac{\ell}{\sqrt{1-e^2}}\right) \quad\text{and}\quad \left(-\frac{e\cdot \ell}{1-e^2},-\frac{\ell}{\sqrt{1-e^2}}\right) .</me>

		Kepler's laws of planetary motion also apply to other celestial bodies that 
        wander around the sun, e.g., asteroids and comets. For example, 
        <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halley%27s_Comet">Halley's Comet</url> 
        is a famous comet which orbits the Sun in <m>75.315</m> years (its last perihelion 
        was in 1986, the next one should be in mid-2061 <mdash/> track it 
        <url href="https://theskylive.com/halley-info">here</url> and you get a page with 
        lots of information; if you do nothing else, at least scroll down to the 
        "Orbit Visualization": Halley's Comet has recently passed its aphelion and is now 
        <em>slowly</em> but <em>increasingly speeding up</em> towards the Sun again.) and was observed 
        from the Earth since ancient times. The eccentricity of its orbit is <m>0.967</m>. 
        Note that Kepler's third law allows us to immediately calculate the semi-major 
        axis of Halley's comet from the knowledge of Earth's semi-major axis: Its length is 
        <m>\sqrt[3]{75.315^2} \approx 17.8</m> times the length of Earth's semi-major axis.
