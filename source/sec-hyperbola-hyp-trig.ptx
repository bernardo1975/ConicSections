  <title>Hyperbolic Trig Functions</title>

  <p>
    We are all familiar with the trigonometric functions cosine, sine and tangent 
    (to name the most prominent ones). There are also sometimes called 
    <em>circular functions</em> because they can be defined on the unit circle. 
    Besides these there is another "family" of functions called the 
    <term>hyperbolic trigonometric functions</term>. In this section, we will explore 
    these and contrast their properties to the usual trigonometric functions (we will 
    call them <em>circular</em> trigonometric functions in the following to distinguish 
    them from the <em>hyperbolic</em> trigonometric functions).
  </p>

  <p>
    Let us start by looking at the graphs of the circular trigonometric functions.
    <sage>
      <input>
      cosgraph = plot(cos(x),(x,-2.2*pi,2.2*pi),color="purple",thickness=2,aspect_ratio=1,legend_label="cos")
			singraph = plot(sin(x),(x,-2.2*pi,2*pi),color="darkgreen",thickness=2, linestyle=":",legend_label="sin")
			tangraph = plot(tan(x),(x,-2.2*pi,2.2*pi),color="red",thickness=2, linestyle="-.",detect_poles=True,ymax=3,ymin=-3,aspect_ratio=1,legend_label="tan")
			cosgraph+singraph+tangraph
      </input>
    </sage>
    The <em>hyperbolic trigonometric functions</em> we would like to consider here are
    <ul>
      <li> the <term>hyperbolic cosine</term> denoted <code>cosh(x)</code>,</li>
      <li> the <term>hyperbolic sine</term> denoted <code>sinh(x)</code>, and</li>
      <li> the <term>hyperbolic tangent</term> denoted <code>tanh(x)</code>.</li>
    </ul>
    Plot them in <em>SageMath</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    You should see that they look quite differently from the circular trigonometric functions. 
    In particular, the hyperbolic tangent seems to have horizontal asymptotes as 
    <m>x\to\pm\infty</m>. We can check that this is indeed the case by calculating 
    <m>\lim\limits_{x\to\infty} \tanh(x)</m>. In <em>SageMath</em> we can calculate 
    this limit as follows:
    <sage>
      <input>
      limit(tanh(x), x=+oo)
      </input>
      <output>
      1
      </output>
    </sage>
    Again, you should now calculate <m>\lim\limits_{x\to-\infty} \tanh(x)</m> in 
    SageMath. Also calculate <m>\lim\limits_{x\to+\infty} \cosh(x)</m>, 
    <m>\lim\limits_{x\to-\infty} \cosh(x)</m>, <m>\lim\limits_{x\to+\infty} \sinh(x)</m> 
    and <m>\lim\limits_{x\to-\infty} \sinh(x)</m> (do you get what you expect?). 
    What do you get if you replace the hyperbolic trigonometric functions with the 
    circular trigonometric functions cosine, sine and tangent? Does this make sense? 
    </p>


    <p>
      In calculus, you calculate derivatives of the circular trigonometric functions, 
      e.g.<fn xml:id="tangent-derivative">Hopefully <em>SageMath</em> gives you the 
      expression <m>\tan^2(x)+1</m> here and not the far more useless expression 
      involving the secant function that CXC/CAPE seems to love having you memorize!</fn>, 
      <sage>
        <input>
        diff(tan(x),x)
        </input>
        <output>
        (tan(x))^2+1
        </output>
      </sage>
      Use <em>SageMath</em> to calculate the derivatives of the hyperbolic trigonometric 
      functions, and make a table comparing the circular trigonometric functions and their 
      derivatives with the hyperbolic trigonometric functions and their derivatives. From 
      this table <mdash/> and the <em>Fundamental Theorem of Calculus</em> <mdash/> it is 
      immediate what the integrals/anti-derivatives of the (hyperbolic or not) sine and 
      cosine are (namely?). For the tangent, we get
      <sage>
        <input>
        integrate(tan(x),x).full_simplify()
        </input>
        <output>
        -log(cos(x))
        </output>
      </sage>
      as anit-derivative <mdash/> note that this expression is missing a 
      <em>constant of integration</em> that you should always include in your work, 
      and that <m>\log</m> here denotes the <em>natural logarithm</em> that you usually 
      might write as <m>\ln</m>. We have included a <code>full_simplify()</code> in the 
      above command to force <em>SageMath</em> to <em>not(!)</em> use the secant. What is 
      an anti-derivative of the hyperbolic tangent?  
    </p>

    <p>
      Let us now turn our attention to definitions: For the tangent we have 
      <m>\tan(x)=\frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)}</m>. For the hyperbolic tangent we 
      similarly have <m>\tanh(x)=\frac{\sinh(x)}{\cosh(x)}</m>, which we can 
      confirm in the following plot:
      <sage>
        <input>
	      plot(sinh(x)/cosh(x),(x,-3,3),thickness=5,color="orange")+plot(tanh(x),(x,-3,3),thickness=3,color="blue",linestyle=":")
	      </input>
	    </sage>
	    This leaves us with the definitions of the hyperbolic cosine and sine.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Let us begin by looking at the following parametric plot: 
        <sage>
          <input>
          t = var('t')
	        parametric_plot((cos(t),sin(t)),(t,0,2*pi),aspect_ratio=1)
	        </input>
	      </sage>
	    This shows us that 
	    <me> t \mapsto \begin{pmatrix} \cos(t) \\ \sin(t) \end{pmatrix} </me>
	    is a <em>parametrization</em> of the <em>unit circle</em> <m>x^2+y^2=1</m>. 
      Thus the coordinates of any point on the circle can be expressed as 
      <m>(\cos(t),\sin(t))</m> for some value of <m>t\in[0,2*\pi)</m>.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    In the introduction to this project, we mentioned that <m>\alpha x^2-\beta y^2=1</m> 
      for some positive parameters <m>\alpha, \beta\gt 0</m> describe hyperbolas. Let us 
      consider the function <m>f(x,y) = x^2 - y^2</m> now, and make a 
      <code>contour_plot</code> of this function (you might want to consult the handout 
      "Plotting in Sage - Part 2/Advanced Plotting in Sage" again for this). Add an 
      <code>implicit_plot</code> to this contour plot that highlights the level set 
      with equation <m>x^2-y^2=1</m>; this is the <em>unit hyperbola</em>. Finally, 
      make a parametric plot similar to the one above, but with cosine and sine 
      replaced by their hyperbolic counterparts (and choose the values for <m>t</m> 
      carefully). 
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    You should see that 
	    <me> t \mapsto \begin{pmatrix} \cosh(t) \\ \sinh(t) \end{pmatrix}, \qquad t\in\mathbb{R} </me>
	    is a <em>parametrization</em> of the <em>unit hyperbola</em> 
      (more precisely, part of it, namely which one?). Now there are many 
      parametrizations of both the unit circle as well as the unit hyperbola, 
      so what makes this one special? E.g., here is another parametrization of the unit circle:
      <sage>
        <input>
	      t = var('t')
				parametric_plot(((1-t^2)/(1+t^2),2*t/(1+t^2)),(t,-10,10),aspect_ratio=1)
	      </input>
	    </sage>
	    That is, 
	    <me> t \mapsto \begin{pmatrix} \frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2} \\ \frac{2t}{1+t^2} \end{pmatrix}, \qquad t\in\mathbb{R} </me>
	    also yields the unit circle (this parametrization turns out to be useful 
      when one integrates functions containing trigonometric functions). The 
      property that makes the parametrization
	    <me> t \mapsto \begin{pmatrix} \cos(t) \\ \sin(t) \end{pmatrix}, \qquad t\in[0,2\pi) </me>
	    useful is that there is an immediate interpretation of the parameter <m>t</m> in this case:
	    <ul>
	      <li>it is the angle at the origin measured in radians, or, alternatively, </li>
	      <li>it is the length of the circular arc on the unit circle from the point 
        <m>(1,0)</m> to <m>(\cos(t),\sin(t))</m> in counter-clockwise direction.</li>
	    </ul>
	    As a result, the trigonometric functions can all be defined on the unit circle.
	  </p>

		<p>
			Instead of an angle (or arc length), the parameterization for the hyperbolic 
      functions is related to an <em>area</em>. To motivate this, let us have a look 
      at the unit circle again: The circular sector between the <m>x</m>-axis and the 
      segment connecting the origin with the point <m>(\cos(\alpha),\sin(\alpha))</m> 
      on the circle has area <m>\frac12\alpha</m>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Now let us look at the similar area on the unit hyperbola:
		</p>

		<image source="unithyperbola.png"/>

		<p>
		  What is the area of the shaded region here? This area is bounded by the straight 
      line from the origin to the point <m>(\cosh(x),\sinh(x))</m> (for a fixed value of 
      <m>x</m>) on the hyperbola, the <m>x</m>-axis and the unit hyperbola <m>x^2-y^2=1</m> 
      (what do you get if you make <m>y</m> the subject?). Calculate this area in 
      <em>SageMath</em>, and confirm that its value is <m>\frac12\,x</m> for your 
      chosen value of <m>x</m>.
		</p>

		<p> 
			In fact, it turns out that the hyperbolic cosine and sine can be expressed 
      using the exponential function as
			<me> \cosh(x) = \frac{e^x+e^{-x}}{2} \quad\text{and}\quad \sinh(x) = \frac{e^x-e^{-x}}{2} .
			</me>
			You should be familiar with corresponding formulae for the (circular) cosine and sine 
      from <em>Euler's formula</em> which one uses in <em>de Moivre's formula</em> <mdash/> state them.
